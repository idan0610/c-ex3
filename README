Answers to Questions:
1. Defining the whole struct inside the h file opens its members to the users uses include for the
h file. In that way they can change the members directly and may accidently  cause for errors or 
memory leaks. Preventing the users accessing the members of the struct and allowing them only use
the functions declared in the h file that have been tested and are working propely help them
to proram safely.

2. The compiler doesn't need to know what are the private members and their size of the struct.
The members of the struct are hidden and so there is no access to any of the private members for
every file using MyString.h. The compiler only check that the struct exist when the is an instance
of the struct.
